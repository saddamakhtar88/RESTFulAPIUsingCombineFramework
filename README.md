# RESTful APIs using Combine Framework

Sample app for how to interact with Restful APIs using Combine Framework

This is not being developed as a Swift package because the idea of this sample is to have network layer raw implementation part of your individual project for finer control. Copy the relevant folders/files in your project and customize it (if required) as per your need.

### Approach:
- Reactive (Using Combine.Framework)
- Type safety
- Protocol oriented
- Dependency Injection
- Unit testing
- Without a third party dependency to have full control over the implementation

I have used [DependecyRegistry](https://github.com/saddamakhtar88/DependencyRegistry) Swift package for managing the dependencies. This is developed by myself. You may use one of your own.
